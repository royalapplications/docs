# Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-Factor authentication can be configured to further secure the access to the Document Store component.

### Accessing the Document Store component

If you have Multi-Factor authentication configured, opening a document hosted by Royal Server only works when the user has the proper permissions, the proper Access Rules are met (if configured) and if the user can provide the second factor (via using his Smartphone).
