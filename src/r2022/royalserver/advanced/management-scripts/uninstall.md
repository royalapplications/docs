# Cleanup an Installation

Royal Server is installed via an MSI package. Uninstalling Royal Server is just a matter of seconds.

Royal Server modifies your machine in the following ways:

- it creates multiple local Windows User Groups
- it creates a Windows EventLog `Royal Server Log`
- it creates two Windows Firewall Rules
- it stores settings in the Windows Registry
- it leaves uninstall information created by the MSI package
- it creates two default certificates and registers them with the Royal Server application
- it creates a settings file at `%APPDATA%\RoyalServer\appsettings.json`
- it creates a configuration database at  `%APPDATA%\RoyalServer\royalserverv4.db`
- it creates a logging directory for requests and responses
- it creates an appsettings.json file
- it creates Performance Counters

You can either remove these artifacts manually or use our script for this. You can find it in `<royal-server-installation-directory>\scripts\cleanup_installation.ps1`. For each step, the script is asking for permission to do the necessary changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Any logfiles generated by Royal Server are not deleted by the script.
