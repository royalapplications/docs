# Cleanup an Installation

Royal Server is installed via an MSI package. Uninstalling Royal Server is just a matter of seconds.

Royal Server modifies your machine in the following ways:

- it creates the following local Windows User Groups: `Royal Server Users`, `Royal Secure Gateway Users`, `Royal Server Administrators`
- it creates a Windows EventLog `Royal Server Log`
- it creates two Windows Firewall Rules: `Royal Server Modules` and `Royal Server Secure Gateway (SSH tunnel)`
- it stores configuration information in the Windows Registry
- it creates uninstall information stored by the MSI package
- it creates two default certificates and registers them with the Royal Server application: `Royal Server` and `Royal Server-Secure Gateway`
- it creates a settings file at `%APPDATA%\RoyalServer\appsettings.json`
- it creates a configuration database at `%APPDATA%\RoyalServer\royalserverv4.db`
- it creates a logging directory for logs
- it creates Performance Counters in the category `Royal Server`
- it creates license files

You can either remove these artifacts manually or use our script for this. You can find it in `<royal-server-installation-directory>\scripts\cleanup_installation.ps1`. For each step, the script is asking for permission to do the necessary changes.

For each step in the script it

1. checks if there is something to be cleaned up
2. asks permission to delete the artefact
3. if confirmed, it deletes the artefact

> [!NOTE]
> Any log files generated by Royal Server are not deleted by the script.
