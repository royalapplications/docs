# Licensing

Please check out our [License Agreement](https://www.royalapps.com/go/kb-server-main-licenseagreement).

Royal Server V4 does not contain a default license, but we will gladly extend trial licenses. Please get your trial license under [https://www.royalapps.com/trial/](https://www.royalapps.com/trial/) in order to test Royal Server without any functional limitation.

Alternatively, you can buy a license. Each license includes at least a 12 month software maintenance (free upgrades and priority email support). For more information visit: [https://www.royalapps.com/server/](https://www.royalapps.com/server/).

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that Royal Server and Royal TS/X are licensed separately. So if you are purchasing a Royal Server license (aka server) you still need clients for most scenarios (aka Royal TS/X).
