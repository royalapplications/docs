# Certificate Store

Create, remove or export certificates.

> [!NOTE]
> The shown certificates are the ones that are installed in the Personal Store of your local machine.


**Add a certificate**

This allows you to create a new certificate by specifying a subject, an optional friendly name and a key length. The resulting certificate will be installed in the Personal Store on your local machine.

''Export a Certificate**

Allows you to export the selected certificate to a *.pfx file by specifying a password. The exported certificate can later be used on other Royal Server installations to create a highly available multi-server Royal Server setup.
