Royal TS is the perfect tool for server admins, system engineers, developers and IT focused information workers who need to access remote systems with different protocols (RDP, VNC, SSH, HTTP/S etc.) Within Royal TS you define your management connections (e.g. Terminal Services) and use Royal Server for accessing these resources. Additionally you can tunnel traffic of connection types like Remote Desktop, VNC or Terminal through the Secure Gateway component of Royal Server. See [How is Royal Server working](./how-is-royal-server-working.md). The configuration information (IPs/names of servers, credentials etc) can not only be stored in a local file but also in Royal Server and provide a single source of information for teams.
