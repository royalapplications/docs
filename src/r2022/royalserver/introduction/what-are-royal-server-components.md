# Royal Server Components

Royal Server comes with multiple components. Currently there are three components (additional components are already on our roadmap):

- **Management Endpoint**  
  This component helps you manage your servers remotely. It enables you to manage Windows Services, Windows Events, Windows Processes, Hyper-V machines, Terminal Services, execute Powershell Scripts and manage VMware virtual machines through Royal Server.
- **Secure Gateway**  
  The Secure Gateway enables Royal TS clients to automatically tunnel all the traffic through a secure tunnel. This works for Remote Desktop Connections, VNC, SSH/Telnet and Web Pages.
- **Document Store**  
  The Document Store enables Royal TS clients to open/save Royal Documents directly from/to Royal Server. This setup is perfect for the usage within teams as it centralizes the storage of these documents.
- **Royal Server Configuration Tool**  
  Not really being a component, it is the user interface to configure Royal Server.
