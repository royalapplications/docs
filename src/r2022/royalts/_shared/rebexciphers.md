#### Ciphers
Use drag and drop, ALT + UP and ALT + DOWN keys or use the up and down buttons in the cipher header bar to reorder the list of algorithm. Checking/unchecking an algorithm will enable/disable it.  

You can configure the following ciphers:
- Encryption Key Algorithms
- Host Key Algorithms
- Key Exchange Algorithms
- Mac Algorithms

> [!Warning]
> Ciphers with a warning icon are considered weak (insecure).
