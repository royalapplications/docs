The **Royal Server** page allows you to configure a Royal Server object for supported connections or choose to use a Royal Server configuration from the parent folder.

#### Use Royal Server from the parent folder
If checked, Royal TS will look for a configured Royal Server in the parent folder. This option is not available on the document level.

#### Direct Connect (No Royal Server)
This is the default value. If selected, no Royal Server is used and Royal TS will directly connect to the remote computer.

#### Specify a Royal Server object
The selected Royal Server object is used for supported connections.
