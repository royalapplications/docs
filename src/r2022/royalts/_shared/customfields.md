## ![](/r2022/images/RoyalTS/Application/SVG_PageCustomFields_32.svg#img_header) Custom Fields
The **Custom Fields** page allows you to enter and store additional information for the object. Custom fields can be used in tasks and templates to inject values from the context connection.

Standard custom fields are also shown in the folder dashboard views and in the properties panel. Protected custom fields can be used to store confidential data (for example when you need an additional password in a task). If you make use of protected custom fields, make sure you encrypt and password protect your document.

> [!Note]
> Custom fields can be used in Tasks and in the Properties Panel. You can put web page URLs (like an iLO management address) or command lines (such as programs or batch files) in the custom fields and execute them using tasks or directly from the properties panel. Each individual custom field can also be configured to be inherited from the parent folder.
