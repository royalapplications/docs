# Introducing Royal Server
With Royal Server, there's no need to transmit screen content, mouse and keyboard data to view Windows Events or restart a service. Royal Server is a Secure Gateway for remote connections and provides common remote management tasks for our Royal TS/X cross-platform clients on Windows, macOS, iOS and Android. Royal Server comes with multiple components. Currently there are three components available:

## Document Store
The built in document store in Royal Server allows you to store Royal TS/X documents directly on the Royal Server. Royal TS for Windows, Royal TSX for macOS and Royal TS for mobile allows you to access those documents. No more files that are copied around and possibly out of date.

## Secure Gateway
A Secure Gateway is a component included in Royal Server which can be used to access computers through an encrypted SSH tunnel (aka port forwarding). Those computers are usually not directly reachable. Royal Server's secure gateway acts like a jump host for Remote Desktop (RDP), Terminal (SSH, Telnet), File Transfer, Web Pages (using the Chrome based plugin) and VNC connections.

## Management Connections
Royal Server also enables Royal TS users to execute common management tasks across platforms - completely without connecting to a remote desktop based console (RDP, VNC, etc.). With Royal Server you can easily view Windows Events, manage Services, Processes, Terminal Sessions and Hyper-V instances in Royal TS - even on macOS or mobile. Royal Server adds an additional security layer to protect your environment using a secure SSL encrypted communication channel and is installed within minutes!
