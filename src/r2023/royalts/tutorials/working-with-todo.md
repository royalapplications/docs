# Working with To-Do Items
Royal TS includes a very simple to-do manager.

A to-do item can be created in the navigation tree to track some tasks. You can also open the **To-Do Items** panel for a filtered view of all your to-do items.

A to-do item can have a name, description, and a state (active or completed) and does not show a dashboard when selected. To edit a to-do item, simply double-click on the item in the navigation tree.

## Create a To-Do Item
1.  In the **Navigation** panel, select a folder.
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Edit** group, click on **Add**.
3.  Click on **To-Do** in the drop down menu.
4.  Type a to-do item name.

## Edit a To-Do Item
To edit a to-do item, simply double-click it in the navigation tree. A pop-over will be shown which allows you to change the state, name and description.

## Quickly change the State
Clicking the to-do item icon in the navigation tree also allows you to quickly change the state of the to-do item to **Active** (unchecked) or **Completed** (checked).
