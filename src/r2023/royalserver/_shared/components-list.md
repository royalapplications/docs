Royal Server comes with several components. Currently there are three components:

- **[Management Endpoint](xref:royalserver_components_management)**  
  This component helps you remotely manage your servers. It allows you to manage Windows Services, Windows Events, Windows Processes, Hyper-V machines, Terminal Services, execute Powershell Scripts and manage VMware virtual machines through Royal Server.

- **[Secure Gateway](xref:royalserver_components_secure-gateway)**  
  The Secure Gateway allows Royal TS clients to automatically tunnel all the traffic through a secure tunnel. This works for Remote Desktop Connections, VNC, SSH/Telnet and Web Pages.

- **[Document Store](xref:royalserver_components_document-store)**  
  The Document Store allows Royal TS clients to open/save Royal Documents directly from/to Royal Server. This setup is perfect for team use as it centralizes the storage of these documents.
