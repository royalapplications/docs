## Setup of Royal Server
Royal Server needs to be running, make note of the [Primary Server Binding (the IP and Port Royal Server is using)](xref:royalserver_management_service-configuration), we will use this later on.

## Setup of Royal TS
In order to use Royal Server from Royal TS/X, first you need to createa a new document.

> [!NOTE]
> The steps outlined here are very similar to our Royal TSX product for macOS.

If you have not done yet, create a new document.

> [!NOTE]
> The application document is a special kind of document, stores important application settings (Options) and also features some out-of-the-box command tasks. You cannot add connections directly to the application document. Create your own document(s) to store connections.

Specify a name and save the document.
