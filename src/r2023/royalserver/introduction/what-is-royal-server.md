# What is Royal Server?

1 Sending screen, mouse and keyboard data just to read Windows events or restart a service? Seems like overkill! Royal Server provides common remote management tasks to the cross-platform Royal TS/X clients for Windows, macOS, iOS and Android - using their native user interface. The combination of Royal Server and the award-winning Royal TS/X remote management clients takes remote systems management to a whole new level.

## The Problem

Royal TS/X has a long history of working with graphics based remote connections such as Remote Desktop Protocol based connections. These types of connections lack usability when it comes to touch enabled and/or small device form factors (think mobile phones or small tablets) and low bandwidth environments. Royal Server is here to change that!

## The Vision

We believe that the most common operations on remote servers are task based and shouldn't necessarily require a graphics based remote connection. Checking event logs on all your backup servers should not require a remote desktop based management solution. That's why we're working hard to offload more and more management tasks and make you happy.

## The Solution

Royal Server is designed to fill this gap, providing common management tasks for specific operations. Our client applications are designed to provide access to all these tasks using the native user interface of the platform or device. For example, restarting a Windows service on multiple hosts has never been faster or easier. Instead of connecting to a machine using a GUI and clicking around, you simply issue the command "restart the Windows service called 'Spooler' on 192.168.1.1". This saves bandwidth and is much faster - especially if you want to do this on multiple machines at the same time.
