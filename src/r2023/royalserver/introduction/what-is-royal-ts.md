# What is Royal TS?

Royal TS is the perfect tool for server administrators, system engineers, developers and IT-focused information workers who need to access remote systems using different protocols (RDP, VNC, SSH, HTTP/S, etc.) Within Royal TS you define your management connections (e.g. Terminal Services) and use Royal Server to access these resources. In addition, you can tunnel traffic of connection types such as Remote Desktop, VNC or Terminal through the Secure Gateway component of Royal Server. See [How does Royal Server work](./how-is-royal-server-working.md). The configuration information (IPs/server names, credentials, etc.) can be stored not only in a local file but also in Royal Server, providing a single source of information for teams.
