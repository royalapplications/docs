# Licensing

## Show or Activate the Licenses Panel

In The Royal Server Configuration Tool Navigation Bar, click on the **General** group and then on the **Licenses** entry.

Each Royal Server installation requires an installed license.

Please check out our [License Agreement](https://www.royalapps.com/go/kb-server-main-licenseagreement).

## Trial Licenses
For testing purposes we gladly issue trial licenses. Please get your 30-day trial license under [https://www.royalapps.com/trial/](https://www.royalapps.com/trial/) in order to test Royal Server with all features.

## Purchased Licenses
Each license includes at least a 12 month software maintenance (including free upgrades and priority email support). For more information visit: [https://www.royalapps.com/server/](https://www.royalapps.com/server/).

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that [Royal Server](https://www.royalapps.com/server/) and [Royal TS/X](https://www.royalapps.com/ts/) are licensed separately. So if you are purchasing a Royal Server license (aka server) you still need client licenses for most scenarios (aka Royal TS/X). If you have questions to our licensing, don't hesitate to [get in touch with our support team](https://support.royalapps.com/support/tickets/new).


## Features

- Use the **Add License** button to add another license

> [!NOTE]
> Installed licenses can be found at `%ProgramData%\RoyalServer\Licenses\`.
