# ![](/r2021/images/RoyalTS/Plugins/Connections/RemoteDesktop/SVG_PluginIcon_32.svg#img_header) Remote Desktop 
The **Remote Desktop** connection *(based on Microsoft RDP ActiveX)* can be used to connect to remote computers or Hyper-V guests using the remote desktop protocol (RDP) which is built into Windows.

## Dashboard
The **Remote Desktop Dashboard** is shown in the **Dashboard** panel when you select a Remote Desktop connection in the **Navigation** panel. Depending on the Hyper-V configuration of your connection you will either see the **Hyper-V** dashboard pane, the **Sessions** dashboard pane, or both.

![RemoteDesktop_Dashboard](/r2021/images/RoyalTS/Plugins/Connections/RemoteDesktop/remotedesktop_dashboard.png)

## Hyper-V Features
-   List of all hosted Hyper-V guests (or instances) and their state.
-   Grid search and customization, including sort, filter and group.
-   **Start, Pause, Save State and Shut Down** Hyper-V guests directly from the **Dashboard**.
-   **Add** a new **Remote Desktop** connection based on the original settings combined with the guest properties.  
    Royal TS assumes the guest name as the host name for the new connection.
-   **Add** a new **Hyper-V Instance** connection based on the selected guest.  
    Royal TS creates a new **Remote Desktop** connection configured to connect directly to the Hyper-V guest.
-   **Connect (Ad Hoc)** allows you to connect directly to the selected Hyper-V guest.

> [!Important]
> The Hyper-V dashboard pane relies on **WMI**. Ensure that all the necessary firewall ports for WMI are open and that the user account running Royal TS (beware of UAC) or the credentials set in the Remote Desktop connection have local administrative rights on the remote **Hyper-V host computer**.

## Sessions Features
-   List of all terminal services sessions and their state.
-   Grid search and customization, including sort, filter and group.
-   Send a message to appear on the desktop of the selected remote session(s).
-   Reset a selected remote session (similar to a forced log off).
-   Restart the remote server.

> [!Important]
> The **Sessions** dashboard pane relies on **RPC communication**. Ensure that all the necessary firewall ports for RPC communication are open and that the user account running Royal TS (beware of UAC) have local administrative rights on the remote computer.

## Royal Server Support
The dashboard data can also be gathered using a Royal Server. For more information about Royal Server, click [here](xref:royalts_intro_royalserver).

## Dashboard Settings
To configure the application default settings for the included dashboard, open the [Plugins Management](xref:royalts_intro_plugins) and click on Dashboard for the Remote Desktop plugin.  
To configure individual dashboard settings for a connection, use the [Dashboard](#dashboard) property page.

## Plugin Settings
To configure the Remote Desktop plugin settings, open the [Plugins Management](xref:royalts_intro_plugins) and click on **Settings** for the Remote Desktop plugin:

#### Client Version
Specify which RDP client version should be used. If **Automatic** (Default) is selected, the latest version available will be used.

### Disconnect and Reconnect
#### Fast Smart Reconnect
If checked, Royal TS will use the faster reconnect method introduced in RDP 8 whenever possible. Disable this setting in case you experience issues with smart reconnect.

#### Force Smart Reconnect on all Sessions
If checked, Royal TS will invoke smart reconnect on all sessions as soon as it is invoked on one. Disable this setting in case you experience issues with smart reconnect.

#### Close tab when user logs off, reboots or disconnects
If checked, Royal TS will also close tabs when a log off, reboot or disconnect from within the session is initiated.  
This setting is only effective when **Keep tabs open when disconnected remotely** in the [User Interface](xref:royalts_reference_options#-user-interface) option is checked.

#### Auto Reconnect on Disconnected Tab
If checked, the automatic reconnect feature will be enabled when the disconnected tab is shown.

#### Always Reconnect
If checked, the automatic reconnect feature will always be enabled when the disconnected tab is shown, including events like signing out the remote session or rebooting the remote computer.

### Advanced
#### Set Domain to '.' for Local Accounts:
If checked, a dot ('.') will be used as domain for local account user names if no domain is specified.

#### Disable Click Detection
If checked, Royal TS will not be able to detect clicks inside a remote session. This should only be used for troubleshooting.

## Connection Properties
The Remote Desktop Properties dialog is shown:
- for a new Remote Desktop connection by clicking the **Remote Desktop** menu item in the **Add** drop down menu in the **Edit** group on the **Home** ribbon tab.
- for an existing Remote Desktop connection by selecting a Remote Desktop connection and clicking on the **Properties** command in the **Edit** group on the **Home** ribbon tab.
- as a bulk-edit dialog when multiple Remote Desktop connections were selected in the **Folder / Document Dashboard** and the **Properties** command in the **Edit** group on the **Home** ribbon tab is clicked. Â

#### Color Depth
The color depth (in bits per pixel) for the control's connection.

> [!Note]
> Higher color depth needs more bandwidth. If you are working with slow connections, reduce the color depth.

#### Desktop Size
Select one of the predefined desktop sizes or specify your own desktop width and height.

#### Resize Mode
Configure how Royal TS handles session window resize events.

- **Scroll Bars**  
  Decreasing the window size will show scroll bars in the remote session.
- **Smart Sizing**  
  Decreasing the window size will scale down the remote session.
- **Smart Reconnect**  
  Changing the window size will force a reconnect, so that the remote desktop will adapt to the new size.

> [!Note]
> Keep in mind that a large desktop size and high color depth drastically increases memory usage of Royal TS - especially when you connect to many servers at the same time.

### Authentication
#### Authentication Level
Specifies the authentication level to use for the connection.
- **Connect and do not warn me if server authentication fails**  
  No authentication of the server.
- **Do not connect, if server authentication fails**  
  Server authentication is required and must complete successfully for the connection to proceed.
- **Connect, but warn me if server authentication fails**  
  Attempt authentication of the server. If authentication fails, the user will be prompted with the option to cancel the connection or to proceed without server authentication.

#### Network Level Authentication
If the computer you want to connect to requires Network Level Authentication, you need to check this option.

> [!Note]
> NLA is enabled by default on Vista/Windows 2008 or later.

#### Use Credential Manager
When checked, Royal TS will create a credential entry in the Windows Credential Manager instead of submitting the credentials to the server.

#### Restricted Admin Mode
In this mode, credentials won't be sent to the remote server, which can protect you if you connect to a remote server that has been compromised. However, connections made from the remote server might not be authenticated by other servers, which might impact app functionality and compatibility.

> [!Note]
> Experimental: Microsoft does not provide an official (public) API for setting the restricted admin mode on the ActiveX control Our implementation is experimental. There's no guarantee that it will always work.

### Connection
#### Compression
Specifies whether compression is enabled.

#### Bitmap Caching
Bitmap caching can improve performance but requires additional memory and disk resources.

#### Public Mode
When enabled, the RDP client does not cache any data on the local system. Use public mode, for example, when connecting to a business server from a system in a conference center.

#### Background Input
When background input is enabled the client accepts mouse input even when Royal TS or the external client window is not active.

#### Session Takeover Warning
When Session Takeover Warning is enabled, the client first checks for terminal sessions and warns the user if a session is already active with the same username.

#### Automatic Reconnect
Specifies whether to enable the client to reconnect automatically to a session in the event of a network disconnection. If checked, enter the number of times to try to reconnect during automatic reconnection.

#### Load Balance Info
Specifies the load balancing cookie that will be placed in the X.224 Connection Request packet.

> [!Tip]
> This field is often used for Azure based connections. After importing .rdp files created by the Azure portal, you may find specific load balancing cookies in your configuration.
