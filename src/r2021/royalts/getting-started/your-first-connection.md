# Your First Connection
## Navigation in Royal TS
The Royal TS user interface provides an **Office-style** [ribbon](xref:royalts_intro_ribbon) menu system and a **Visual Studio-style** [dock panel](xref:royalts_intro_panels) workspace:

When Royal TS is opened for the first time, you will see the [Application](xref:royalts_intro_documents) document in the [Navigation](xref:royalts_ui_panels#navigation) panel. The application document is a special kind of document, stores important application settings ([Options](xref:royalts_reference_options)) and also features some out-of-the-box command tasks.

> [!Note]
> You cannot add connections directly to the application document. Create your own document(s) to store connections. Your own documents can also be used to store credentials and tasks.

## Create a Document
Create a new [document](xref:royalts_reference_organization#document) to store your connections:

Provide a name for the document and click OK.

In this example we add a new [remote desktop connection](xref:royalts_reference_connections_rdp). Enter a display name and computer name for the new connection.

## Connect
Select the connection and click [Connect](xref:royalts_tutorials_connections):
