# What is Royal TS
Royal TS provides powerful, easy and secure access to your remote systems. It's the perfect tool for server admins, system engineers, developers and IT focused information workers who constantly need to access remote systems with different protocols (like RDP, VNC, SSH, HTTP/S, and many more).

Royal TS is the only true cross-platform remote management solution available for **Windows, macOS, iOS and Android.** Documents created with Royal TS can be opened on all the supported platforms. For more information about supported platforms and features, visit our homepage: https://www.royalapps.com

## Shareware Information
Royal TS can be downloaded, installed and used in **Shareware Mode** for free without registration or time limit (no trial expiration!) and without a license key. In Shareware Mode some restrictions apply (see below) but even with those restrictions, Royal TS can be used for free in small environments or evaluated and thoroughly tested before licenses are obtained.

> [!NOTE]
> The following restrictions apply in Shareware Mode:
> - You cannot have more than 10 connections.
> - You cannot have more than 10 credentials.
> - You can open only one Royal TS document. 

To remove the above restrictions, it's required to obtain and [enter a license key](xref:royalts_reference_options#license) in Royal TS. Each license includes at least 12 months of software maintenance (free upgrades and priority email support).

## Credential Management and Team Sharing Features

Royal TS enables you to work safely with your confidential data (such as credentials) by using state of the art encryption technology and smart ways to integrate personal credentials while working with shared files in a team. See also [Working with Personal Credentials in a Shared Document](xref:royalts_tutorials_credentials#working-with-personal-credentials-and-a-shared-document). 

The built-in credential management provides quick and easy access to your credentials in Royal TS connections and in supported web browsers. See also: [Royal Passwords Browser Extensions](https://www.royalapplications.com/passwords/main/features).

In addition, Royal TS can also read and use credentials from [KeePass](xref:advanced_import#import-keepass-v2-file) and can also open personal [LastPass](xref:advanced_import#open-a-lastpass-vault) vaults.
