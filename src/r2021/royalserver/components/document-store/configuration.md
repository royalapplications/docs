## Show or Activate the Document Store Configuration Panel

## Features

**Enable Document Store**

Enable or disable the Document Store.

**Document Store Configuration**

For the Document Store you can further configure:

_Document Store Root Folder_

Specify where Royal Server is storing the documents physically.

_Number of Backups_

When saving a document on Royal Server it always creates a backup first. You can specify how many backups Royal Server should keep.

_Access Rules Enabled_

Additionally to the security restriction that the client needs to have credentials, that are a member of the Windows group "Royal Server Users" Access Rules offer a more fine grained configuration on who can read/write documents. This configuration is then done for each document.

> **Note**  
> Enabling Access Rules immediately denies access to all documents unless read/write access is specified for documents.
