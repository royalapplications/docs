# Document Store

The Document Store is a component in Royal Server that enables the user to securely load and save Royal Documents directly from Royal Server - no more shared files needed.

> **Note**  
> Any user that wants to load or save with the Document Store needs to be a member of the "Royal Server Users" group.  
> Create, import or delete a document requires the user to be member of the "Royal Server Administrators" group. If done via the Configuration Tool, the Worker Account is used for these operations.

## Accessing Documents from the Document Store

In order to access documents, you first need to configure a Royal Server object in any open document in Royal TS/X. This configuration is needed to access Royal Server.

**Opening a Royal Server Document from Royal TS (for Windows)**

- Click on **File** in the Ribbon and then **Open**
- Select the Royal Server you want to connect to, in order to see all pre-configured documents.

**Opening a Royal Server Document from Royal TSX (for macOS)**

- Click on the **File** menu and then **Open** Royal Server Document.
