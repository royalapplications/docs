# Pepare a Managed Server

In the topic [Configuration of Managed Servers](xref:royalserver_introduction_configuration) we have listed the required changes to set up a managed server.

You can do this manually or use our script. You can find it in
`<royal-server-installation-directory>\scripts\prepare_server.ps1`. For each step, the script is asking for permission to do the necessary changes.
