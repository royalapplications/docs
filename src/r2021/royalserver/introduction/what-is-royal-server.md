# What is Royal Server?

Transmitting screen content, mouse and keyboard data to read Windows Events or restart a service? This is so 2014! Royal Server provides common remote management tasks to cross-platform clients Royal TS/X for Windows, macOS, iOS and Android - using their native UI. The combination of Royal Server and the award winning Royal TS/X remote management clients takes remote systems management to a whole new level.

## The Problem

Royal TS/X has a long history of working with graphics based remote connections like Remote Desktop Protocol based connections. These connection types lack usability when it comes to touch enabled and/or small device form factors (think mobile phones or small tablets) and in low-bandwidth environments. Royal Server's about to change that!

## The Vision

We believe that the most common operations on remote servers are task based and shouldn't necessarily require a graphics based remote connection. To examine event logs on all backup servers one should not need to use a remote desktop based management solution. That's why we strive to release more and more management tasks and make you happy.

## The Solution

Royal Server is built to fill the gap and provides common management tasks for specific operations. Our client applications are designed to provide access to all those tasks using the platforms or devices native user interface. For example: restarting a Windows service on multiple hosts has never been that quick and easy. Instead of connecting to a machine using a graphical user Â interface and clicking around, you basically issue the command "restart the Windows Service with the name 'Spooler' on 192.168.1.1". This saves bandwidth and is much faster - especially, when you want to do this on multiple machines at the same time.

## License Information

Royal Server V4 does not contain a default license, but we will gladly extend trial licenses. Please get your trial license under [https://www.royalapps.com/trial/](https://www.royalapps.com/trial/) in order to test Royal Server without any functional limitations.

Alternatively, you can buy a license. Each license includes at least a 12 month software maintenance (free upgrades and priority email support). For more information visit: [https://www.royalapps.com/server/](https://www.royalapps.com/server/).

> Please note that Royal Server and Royal TS/X are licensed separately. So if you are purchasing a Royal Server license (aka server) you still need clients for most scenarios (aka Royal TS/X).
